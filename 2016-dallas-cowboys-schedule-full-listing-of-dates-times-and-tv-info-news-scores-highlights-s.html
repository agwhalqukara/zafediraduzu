Being able to stay mostly healthy—at least in terms of the team's key players—would go a long way toward a strong bounce-back season.</p><p>On the other side of the ball, standout linebacker Sean Lee made 128 combined tackles last season but missed all of the 2014 campaign because of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">torn ACL</a>.</p><p>And that's just the peak of the iceberg. The Cowboys have been forced to overcome numerous injuries to impact players in recent years. That's a major reason why they've been unable to sustain extended playoff runs, even when they succeed in the regular season.</p><p>When it comes to Romo, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones still believes he's the quarterback who can lead the Dallas offense for the foreseeable future. He predicted on 105.3 The Fan in December that the veteran will remain under center for four or five more seasons (via&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rob Phillips</a> of the team's official site):</p><p><span>4-5 years.&nbsp;</span>If you look at his play time, if you look at the years he's actually played, he started late. He really has excellent skills relative to where his skill set began and what his skill set is. More important than anything, from a mental standpoint and the things that also mean so much at quarterback, he's at the top of the list.</p><p>In the short term, keeping him on the field for the entire 2016 season would help the Cowboys mask weaknesses elsewhere on the roster. They will need to score a lot of points if the front seven doesn't improve after ranking 25th in sacks and 22nd in run defense last year.</p><p>So, while health isn't the only factor, it's a crucial one for the Cowboys. Full seasons from Romo, Bryant and Lee would do wonders for the team's postseason chances.</p><p><h2 class=streamElement>Pivotal Matchups</h2></p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/401/201/b9f68e3261d99ac78b01b5c81e01be37_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/401/201/b9f68e3261d99ac78b01b5c81e01be37_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Tony Gutierrez/Associated Press</span><p>There's no doubt the divisional games are the most important ones for Dallas. As mentioned, the NFC East race is usually one of the most competitive in the NFL, at least in recent years, and that will likely be the case once again in 2016.</p><p>Last year, the <a href=#>Washington Redskins</a> were the only team above .500 in division games at 4-2. That should be the minimum goal for the Cowboys if they want to take the crown back.</p><p>Outside of those vital games, the other notable contests on the schedule are road games against the <a href=#>New Orleans Saints</a> and <a href=#>Green Bay Packers</a>. They are two teams Dallas could be battling if it ends up in the wild-card race.</p><p>If the Cowboys can at least split those games along with reaching the 4-2 bar in the division, they likely only need to go 5-3 in the remaining games to make the playoffs. A quick glance at the schedule suggests that's a doable path.</p><p>All told, John Breech of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBSSports.com</a> noted the Cowboys are tied for the fourth-easiest slate based on 2015 records. So, while Dallas has its fair share of concerns heading into the new season, the schedule shouldn't be one of them.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/twitter-badges.s3.amazonaws.com/follow_me-c.png border=1 alt width=160 height=27 align=bottom style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW9qZ2WDenmRaWhvZZSWua2t0maaqK%2BSpMa0edKcn56cpaGybrLUpaNmpJmowaq6xmamn2WUlsGmv4ytoKado2Kur7CMra1moZ6bvA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-troubling-history-and-modern-reassessment-of-stone-mountain-park.html><span>←</span><span>The Troubling History And Modern Reassessment Of Stone Mountain Park</span></a>
