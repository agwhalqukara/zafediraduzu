A former soldier and longtime policeman, he had literally made a career out of following the law. But when Swiss authorities ordered him to deny Jewish people entry into Switzerland, Grüninger quietly defied his superiors.</p><p>From 1938 to 1939, Grüninger falsified 3,600 Jewish refugees’ passports, allowing them to evade detection and enter the country. “I’d rather break the rules than send these poor, miserable people back to Germany,” he said.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-341189 alt="Jewish Refugees" width=900 height=630 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/jewish-refugees.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-341189 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>United States Holocaust Memorial Museum/Courtesy of Ike Bitton</span><span class=caption-body>Jewish refugees attempting to flee Europe.

On another, he paid for a young girl’s visit to the dentist.</p><p>But Swiss officials became suspicious. They had given orders: “Those who are Jews or probable Jews are to be turned back.” Yet a shockingly high number of Jewish refugees seemed to be pouring into the country.</p><p>Before long, Grüninger’s superiors realized that he had defied their directives. As a result, he was fired from his post, found guilty of breaking the law, saddled with a criminal record, and stripped of his pension.</p><p>Despite his punishment, Grüninger never regretted what he had done. “I am not ashamed of the court’s verdict,” he said in 1954. “I am proud to have saved the lives of hundreds of oppressed people… My personal well-being, measured against the cruel fates of these thousands, was so insignificant and unimportant that I never even took it into consideration.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonypu8uompqto6l6qbHRqJysZ2M%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nene-leakes-is-dragged-for-saying-this-in-the-midst-of-the-unrest-and-outrage-following-the-killing.html><span>←</span><span>NeNe Leakes Is Dragged For Saying This In The Midst Of The Unrest And Outrage Following The Killing</span></a>
