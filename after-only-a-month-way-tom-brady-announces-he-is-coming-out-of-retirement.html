Earlier this year after 22 seasons playing quarterback and taking two franchises to the promised land <a href=# rel=noopener>Tom Brady announced he was retiring</a>. This was only after it was <a href=# rel=noopener>leaked from ESPN reporters</a> who didn’t even let the man announce it himself. The suspicious thing about his retirement was how many journalists claimed on good authority he would be returning and they do not believe he is done, leaving everyone confused. Until yesterday when Tom Brady took to social media to announce he would in fact be returning because he just couldn’t take it.</p><p>As of now, we have no idea what is the cause was for his return but between watching the Super Bowl from home and adjusting to regular life we are sure he just had to go for it. Sadly the announcement comes just one day after his final touchdown football sold for over half a million dollars. If Brady makes it to another Super Bowl this is will be another great chapter in his career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpKS6bq7RmpuyZZmoerDB02amn2WimsGqvsSmnKesXZa7r7vUp5qeq11ngLOwjKycmqufo3q4tdOhZK2ZnaWucA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./10-most-expensive-bicycles-in-the-world.html><span>←</span><span>10 most expensive bicycles in the world</span></a>
