Just walking around like they don’t even know what heart they’re about to get,” Woods said to KNOE-TV.</p><p>Family members are still struggling with understanding why this happened, but remembering the person Rosario was has put them at peace.</p><p>According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, emergency departments treated 15,800 treadmill-related accidents in 2020 and 22,500 in 2019. Despite the high numbers, there are still only three to four deaths per year.</p><p>The family is now focused on helping Rosario’s children and on honoring her legacy.</p><p>“We’re grieving, and we’re in loss and saddened, but she’s helping so many people right now. Like, I can’t say that’s not an angel, truly though,” Woods said to KNOE.</p><p>The family has started a GoFundMe page and wants to raise $50,000 for the four children. So far, they’ve raised $23,536 with 278 total donations.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49wZmtvX556pK3NrWSsmaliwamt06xkp6ekYq6vecCnnp6kXZuurrXLsmSmnZ2XsrO%2FjKKlZpyZqK%2BmuMienWaZlqmys3nMqKRmp5Zis7DB0Wabop2jYravecWrnJqjXam%2Fpq3DpqClpF2WsKS1w56lrWWnnbatsYyer56qk57AqrrGaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./who-are-tommy-devito-s-parents-tom-and-alexandra-devito-meet-giants-qb-s-jersey-housemates.html><span>←</span><span>Who are Tommy DeVitos parents: Tom And Alexandra DeVito?
