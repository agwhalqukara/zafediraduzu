The celeb-loved athleisure brand (celebs like Jennifer Garner, Gigi Hadid, Hailey Bieber, Blake Lively—the list can go on forever—have been spotted wearing Alo), which is known for its stylish and upscale workout gear and iconic yoga pants, rarely puts on a sale. But we’re in luck this week: the retailer is hosting its first-ever, site-wide ‘Alo-versary Sale’ and the time to stock on luxe workout goods is here.</p><p>From now through May 14, you can score 20 percent off on dozens of the brand’s top-rated leggings, bras, workout jackets and much more.&nbsp; We already spotted the High-Waist Biker Shorts for less than $50 and the fan-favorite Alosoft High-Waist 7/8 Highlight Leggings for just $78. Also, this is the perfect chance to explore some of the retailer’s new beauty essentials, like their 60-Second Detox & Glow Mask ($38) (an exfoliating solution that helps to smooth and clear pores). So, if you’re looking to upgrade your athleisure looks and add some gym bag staples in the process, now’s the time to strike.</p><p><span class="inline pr-6 text-seafoam-dark">Related Stories</span></p><p>But if you’re overwhelmed with all the goods up for grabs, not to worry. To help you navigate the event, we’ve narrowed down some of the most noteworthy styles for you to snag below. Just an FYI, the Alo Yoga sale has started for VIP members today (May 9), but is officially open to everyone starting May 10.</p><h2 class="text-h2 wg-inline-shopable__title mb-[20px]">Best picks from Alo-versary sale</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/high-waist-camp-vapor-leggings.webp><p>High-Waist Camo Leggings — $76.00</p><p><strong>Originally $128, now $76</strong></p><p>True to their name, the high-waisted Vapor leggings feel like nothing’s there. The matte fabric is velvety soft and stretchy yet supportive. It’s also breathable, never getting sticky or swampy no matter how warm hot yoga gets. No wonder Jennifer Garner loves them so much. Get ’em now while they’re a whopping 40 percent off.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/wellness-bra.png><p>Alo Wellness Bra — $51.00</p><p><strong>Originally $68, now $51</strong></p><p>Blake Lively once proved this comfy, barely-there sports bra is effortless enough to complete a whole look, sans shirt. The body is ribbed, giving it just the right amount of compression for medium-impact sports without going overboard. Perfect or layering, or if you’re like Lively, not.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/alo-soft-78-legging.png><p>Alosoft High-Waist 7/8 Highlight Legging — $78.00</p><p><strong>Originally $98, now $78</strong></p><p>If you could only wear one pair of leggings every day for the rest of the year, consider these yoga pants your go-to. According to multiple reviewers, these are some of the softest and most versatile leggings they’ve ever owned. The secret? The Alosoft fabric, which feels smooth to the touch, and has a sculpting-like effect. All in all, these don’t have a ton of compression but they do have enough support for low-impact workouts and everything else in between.</p><p>“I wear these tights for workouts, yoga, lounging, working from home, and as a cuddly layer under jeans when I go out,” one reviewer commented. “The 7/8 length is just right as a ‘petite’ full length. [And] the high waist does not slide down when I cycle.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/alo-Wild-things-bra.png><p>Wild Things Bra — $51.00</p><p><strong>Originally $64, now $51</strong></p><p>What we love about this bra is that you can wear it with your yoga pants on one day and with your favorite pair of jeans on the next. It’s got moisture-wicking fabric for you to sweat in all day, and padded cups to provide extra coverage (and support) during your more intense workouts. Plus, the ruched detailing and racerback design makes it the perfect bra top to layer with joggers and the rest of your wardrobe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Contour-Jacket.png><p>Contour Jacket — $102.00</p><p><strong>Originally $128, now $102</strong></p><p>Whether you need a quick cover up or something lightweight to put on while you’re on the treadmill, this performance jacket is a safe bet. It fits close to the body and has multiple pockets for you to store small essentials. And as a nice bonus, the fabric is also odor resistant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/alo-high-waist-biker-short.png><p>High-Waist Biker Short — $46.00</p><p><strong>Originally $58, now $46</strong></p><p>If you’re inspired by <span>Princess Diana’s biker shorts</span>-sneaker combo of the ’90s, then these are the perfect fit to help recreate that iconic look. Not only are these shorts super stretchy, but they also feature moisture-wicking fabric to help keep odors at bay. They hit just at the mid-thigh and have mild compression to help sculpt your bum.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Ribbed-tank.png><p>Ribbed Peak Tank — $42.00</p><p><strong>Originally $52, now $42</strong></p><p>If you want to switch up your gym attire, consider adding this Ribbed Peak Tank to your closet. Made from ultra-lightweight fabric, this top is both a win for comfort and style. It fits loosely on the body for a super laidback feel and has two side slits to give you max movement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/alo-set.png><p>Airbrush Suspension Bra and High-Waist Airbrush Legging Set — $125.00</p><p><strong>Originally $156, now $125</strong></p><p>Made with Alo’s signature Airbrush fabric, this bra and leggings set is designed to sculpt, shape and lift all of your best assets. The bra and leggings are incredibly stretchy so you can adjust the fit for your unique body type. Not to mention, the bra has a cool strappy back design and a low neckline to help create a more flattering silhouette.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Alosoft-Courtside-Dress.png><p>Alosoft Courtside Tennis Dress — $86.00</p><p><strong>Originally $108, now $86</strong></p><p>Part of what makes this dress a home run for wearing to the gym or to the studio is its versatile look. It has a built-in pair of shorts and bra top to help with flexibility, freedom of movement, and support. Not to mention, it’s pretty lightweight and super soft to the touch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/alo-sweatpant.png><p>Accolade Sweatpant — $86.00</p><p><strong>Originally $108, now $86</strong></p><p>When it comes to athleisure staples, it doesn’t get any better than a pair of joggers. And these ones are some of the best of the best from the brand, according to reviewers. A big reason for that is their fit. While the pants are designed to be a bit baggy, the fit “makes your butt look great,” one five-star shopper raved.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wellandgood.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Alo-deodorant.png><p>Supernatural Deodorant — $14.00</p><p><strong>Originally $18, now $14</strong></p><p>Need a way to stay fresh after working out? Keep this Supernatural Deodorant in your gym bag. It’s baking soda- and aluminum-free so it won’t block your sweat glands. Instead, this uses a mix of antioxidants, vitamin C, cleansing tea tree and anti-odor probiotics to help prevent odors from lingering in your body. And unlike some deodorants, this one also contains hyaluronic acid to keep your skin hydrated.</p><p>Shop the rest of the sale here.</p><p><strong>Want to be the first to hear about the latest (and greatest) SHOP product drops, custom collections, discounts, and more?
