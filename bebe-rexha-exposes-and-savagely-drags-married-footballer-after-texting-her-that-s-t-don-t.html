Yikes! She savagely exposed the man and fans are living for it since no one likes cheaters!</p><p>Earlier today, Bebe took to her Instagram Story to ambiguously write: ‘Do you ever have that one guy who always comes in and out of your life? And they’re cheaters and waste your time.’</p><p>And that’s not all! She then proceeded to share a text conversation screenshot in which the supposed footballer asks when they should meet in person.</p><p>[media-credit name=”Source: instagram.com” align=”aligncenter” width=”576″]<img decoding=async alt=bebe_rexha_1 width=576 height=1024 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/bebe_rexha_1-576x1024.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>[/media-credit]</p><p>Instead of checking out her schedule to see when she’s available to go on a date, Rexha savagely responded by listing her upcoming performances!</p><p>In another Insta Story, she went on to address the unknown man who apparently is not only married but is also a father of three.</p><p>The singer told him to ‘Be a good role model and play your sports and leave me the f**k alone. Do not be texting me ‘hey friend’ especially if you are a married man. Sorry. That s**t don’t fly with me. Go back to playing football. If only you guys knew.’</p><p>Bebe also took a poll with her followers to see if they thought it was Okay for a married man to text her ‘Hey friend’ since they are not even BFFs or anything and it was, from her point of view, a blatant attempt to subtly flirt with her.</p><p>‘I feel bad for writing that, but it’s how I feel,’ she mentioned.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>It makes sense she reacted like this since Rexha previously revealed in an interview with ET that it was none other than Nicki Minaj who taught her to learn her worth and stand up for herself!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeSmq%2BmedGer6GZXZrFsbvSnqpmmZ6ZerSt1ZqenqSpYrGzrcasZKaZoqe2prCMn6aorJKWua2x0WaYn6yVp3q1sdetoKefXZ2ys3nToZitZaOpeqW7za1kn6SpYsSqwMdmpJ5lYmeGdoWYaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./wwe-s-paul-heyman-john-cena-had-to-be-talked-into-making-make-a-wish-visits-public-news-scores.html><span>←</span><span>WWE's Paul Heyman: John Cena Had to Be Talked into Making Make-A-Wish Visits Public | News, Scores,</span></a>
