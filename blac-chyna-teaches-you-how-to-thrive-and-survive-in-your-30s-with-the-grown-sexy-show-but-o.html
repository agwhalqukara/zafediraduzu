Please continue to be successful!’</p><p>Some of her fans, on the other hand, felt offended by the fact that Chyna associated going to therapy with being crazy and made sure to tell her this in the comments section.</p><p>A person wrote ‘Since when does taking care of your mental health make you crazy? This is so offensive. 🙄’</p><p>Someone else agreed and said ‘You don’t have to be crazy to see a therapist smh.’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BsOe7DYgUvA/</p><p>One of Chyna’s follower wrote ‘Everyone could use therapy. Even if nothing is troubling you, it helps you grow as a person. If you took up some therapy, you might grow more mature, enough to understand that therapy isn’t just for “crazy” people. Wisdom and maturity are two things that are never completely gained, my friend. It’s always a process.’</p><p>Another commenter also said ‘That doesn’t make you crazy it makes you more self-aware so that you don’t misdirect anger or any other emotions. Just throwing that out there. Different strokes for different folks though🤷🏽‍♀️ Happy New year 🎆’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>What do you think about the subject?
