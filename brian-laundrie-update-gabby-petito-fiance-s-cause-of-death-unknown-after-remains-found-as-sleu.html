In the days following Gabby’s reported disappearance, police were monitoring the Laundrie family home.
However, Brian slipped away from their watch, when investigators thought his mother was him.
“They are built kind of similarly,” said North Port Police Department spokesperson Josh Taylor to WINK News on Monday.
Police observed Brian driving away from the home in his Mustang, but believed he returned a few days later, when they saw his mother driving the vehicle back to the residence."><meta name=author content="Martina Birk"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
