It is based on Charles Addams’ cartoon The Addams Family’s fictitious character Wednesday Addams.&nbsp;The titular character is played by Jenna Ortega, who has previously been in Jane the Virgin, Stuck in the Middle, You, and The Fallout. Meanwhile, Catherine Zeta-Jones will play her mother, Morticia Addams. The series represents Zeta-Jones’ first collaboration with the streaming service. She was last seen as Claremont Psychiatric Hospital’s resident medical doctor, Vivian Capshaw, in season two of Prodigal Son (2019-2021).</p><h2>Morticia is a well-known female character: Zeta-Jones on her Wednesday character</h2><p>In a recent interview with the TV Times, the performer praised Morticia as “an iconic female figure,” but stressed that she wanted to put her own spin on the role.&nbsp;She expressed a desire not to portray Morticia as a “Halloween-costumed caricature.” Zeta-Jones said that she wanted to get to the heart of the character since Morticia had two children and was madly in love with her husband. According to the actress:</p><p>“We didn’t want to modernize Morticia by putting her in pants; we wanted to do the original appearance.”</p><p>She continued, saying:</p><p>“So when I initially put on the outfit, hair, and make-up, I was so into it that I could have passed for Morticia at a gas station!”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Catherine-Zeta-Jones-1.jpg alt="Catherine Zeta-Jones" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>The sitcom has enormous shoes to fill since the Addams Family series is a cult favorite. In response to the concerns, Zeta-Jones said that the series will be popular because it took the narrative into the twenty-first century and “the family is dealing with all of these challenges that are important today.”</p><h2>How rich is Catherine Zeta-Jones?</h2><p>Zeta-Jones, who was born on September 25, 1969, is a multi-award-winning actress.

Its summary is as follows:</p><p>“Weekend Addams, smart, sarcastic, and a touch dead inside, investigates a murder spree while finding new friends — and opponents — at Nevermore Academy.”</p><p>Aside from Ortega and Zeta-Jones, the series also stars Luis Guzmán as Gomez Addams, Morticia’s husband, and Wednesday’s father. Gwendoline Christie of Game of Thrones will play another important character, Larissa Weems. Isaac Ordonez will portray Pugsley Addams, Morticia, and Gomez’s kid.
