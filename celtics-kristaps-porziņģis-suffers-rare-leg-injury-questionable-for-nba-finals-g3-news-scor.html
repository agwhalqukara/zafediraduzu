He also appeared to tweak his right leg in Game 2. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ETjPWm5gtm">pic.twitter.com/ETjPWm5gtm&lt;/a></p><p>ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Adrian Wojnarowski</a> reported Porziņģis is "determined and expects to continue to try and play with this tendon injury in the Finals," adding "there's no indication he'll be ruled out and not permitted to try in Game 3."</p><p>While the team's announcement and Wojnarowski's report appeared to leave open the possibility for Porziņģis to return at some point during the NBA Finals against the Dallas Mavericks, head coach Joe Mazzulla painted a different picture. He told reporters this is a "serious injury."</p>NBA TV <span class=acct>@NBATV</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>"It's a serious injury. At the end of the day, the medical team is not going to put him in any bad situations. We've taken the decision to play out of his hands."&lt;br>&lt;br>Joe Mazzulla on Porziņģis' day-to-day status &lt;a href="https://t.co/cBTfIMdoPd">pic.twitter.com/cBTfIMdoPd&lt;/a></p><p>Porziņģis' status for Game 3 was already the subject of some uncertainty because he appeared to aggravate his calf problem in Boston's 105-98 Game 2 victory. He played 23 minutes and finished with 12 points and four rebounds, but he left with 4:40 on the clock in the fourth quarter and didn't return.</p><p>After the game, the 7'2" big man downplayed the significance of the situation.</p><p>"I feel good," he <a href=# rel=noopener>told reporters</a>. "Feeling good. I don't think it's anything serious. But we'll look at it tomorrow and go from there. But all good. I'll be good."</p><p>At this point, it's anybody's guess as to whether Porziņģis will suit up again in the Finals and how much he might be allowed to play if he is cleared. Based on how he looks and sounds, you'd guess he's on track for a return Wednesday night.</p>Jared Weiss <span class=acct>@JaredWeissNBA</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Just walked past Porziņģis and he seems to be in good spirits and walking comfortably. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ydRD0goo29">https://t.co/ydRD0goo29&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/dKvCHDRMVd">pic.twitter.com/dKvCHDRMVd&lt;/a></p>Adam Himmelsbach <span class=acct>@AdamHimmelsbach</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Porzingis: "I'll do everything I have to to be out there tomorrow….nothing is going to stop me unless I'm told I'm not allowed to play."</p><p>However, that picture is at clear odds with what the Celtics and their head coach have presented publicly.</p><p>The Mavericks have dropped the first two games of the Finals and their best player is <a href=#>operating at less</a> than 100 percent. In short, Dallas is in very real danger.</p><p>Porziņģis' injury doesn't single-handedly swing the series in the Mavs' favor, but it's the kind of break they could certainly use.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmmBcX6MnJylrJmYwG630aKqrZmgqHqxu9GzoKefmah6tMHFn5yrq12nrrOxjKWcoGWZo7e2vthmm5qxXam8brDAsmSfp6Jiu6OtjJ%2Bgp5mcqA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./brits-2018-este-haim-steals-the-show-with-drunk-cameo.html><span>←</span><span>BRITs 2018: Este Haim Steals The Show With 'Drunk' Cameo</span></a>
