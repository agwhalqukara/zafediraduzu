Yet, having released her own single, and collaborated with brands like Ralph Lauren, her older sister Dixie has gained popularity in her own light.&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>Read more about who of the two D’Amelio sisters is more popular, how they became so famous on the TikTok app, and their individual careers.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The TikTok Sisters&nbsp;</h2><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Charli’ and Dixie D’Amelio</a> are two sisters from Connecticut, who were unknown to the world until they started uploading upbeat and entertaining dance and comedy videos to TikTok in mid 2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Quickly, <a href=# rel=noopener>Charli</a> stood out on the app, and garnered 5 million followers on TikTok within a week of posting on the app as her dance cover of the song ‘Lottery Renegade’ went viral.&nbsp;</p><p>Within a year, <a href=# rel=noopener>Charli</a> became TikTok’s most-followed user, with over 66 million followers and 2 billion likes on the app.&nbsp;</p><p>Her easily copyable dance routines, girlish looks and funny personality turned her into what the <a href=# rel=noopener>New York Times</a> famously called the ‘reigning queen of TikTok.’&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>Beyond the app, <a href=# rel=noopener>Charli</a> has become an exceptionally popular as well as lucrative influencer and media personality: She has appeared on the ‘Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon’, was tapped by Prada to promote its haute couture collection at Milan Fashion Week, and became the first TikToker to be featured in a Super Bowl commercial.&nbsp;</p><p>Having said publicly that she aspires to be a professional dancer, most of <a href=# rel=noopener>Charli’s TikTok</a> videos are thus dance videos.&nbsp;</p><p>With her dancing ambition and talent, <a href=# rel=noopener>Charli </a>has danced with the Jonas Brothers and Bebe Rexha on stage and danced with JLO for the Super Bowl challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>But while Charli has been catapulted to fame via TikTok, so has her older sister, Dixie.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dixie’s Own Career&nbsp;</h2><p>As Charli D’Amelio’s older sister, <a href=# rel=noopener>Dixie</a> also quickly rose to fame.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>While she has less followers on social media channels like TikTok and Instagram than Charli, <a href=# rel=noopener>Dixie</a> has been adamant on carving her own path to success, wholly separate from her famous sister.&nbsp;</p><p>Asked in an interview about her own career on TikTok, <a href=# rel=noopener>Dixie explained</a> that while Charli is focussed on dancing, she wants to build her distinctive brand away from dancing and instead branch out into acting and singing.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>She said</a>: ‘Being able to do comedy, or skits, or just talking on TikTok is kind of my lane and where I stay.’</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>She went on</a> to highlight that ‘Charli and I are two different people […]. I don’t want to do what she’s doing. I don’t want to be a dancer, because that’s her thing and I have my thing.’&nbsp;</p><p>As<a href=# rel=noopener> she has</a> become successful in her own light as a comedian on TikTok, Dixie has acted in a TV series called ‘Attaway General.’&nbsp;</p><p>Further solidifying her success, <a href=# rel=noopener>she has also</a> worked with brands like Dermalogica, Hollister and Polo Ralph Lauren.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, <a href=# rel=noopener>she released</a> her debut single, “Be Happy” which reached the Billboard Charts at 41 on the Emerging Artist list.&nbsp;</p><p>This shows that while Charli may boast more followers than Dixie and be more popular commercially among the two D’Amelio sisters, Dixie has been successful in forging her own path and her own career in singing and acting.</p><p>And ultimately, regardless of follower count, it can be said that both D’Amelio sisters are exceptionally popular anyway.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jpyfmqqcnnqlrcyeo6KnXavAbrDIsaCeZZSWuqa4yKhksKCfqHquu9GeZKmnoKq5or6O</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./247-news-around-the-world.html><span>←</span><span>247 News Around The World</span></a>
