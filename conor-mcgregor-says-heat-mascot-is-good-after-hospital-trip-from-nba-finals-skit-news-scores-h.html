It was all part of the show!"</p><p>During Game 4 of the NBA Finals on Friday, McGregor participated in what was supposed to be a fun skit with Burnie the mascot to promote his new Tidl pain relief spray. Unfortunately, the boxing match ended quickly with the mascot receiving one of the former two-division champion's patented left hooks, followed by another when he hit the ground.</p>SportsCenter <span class=acct>@SportsCenter</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Conor McGregor KO'd the Heat mascot üòÖ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NBAFinals?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NBAFinals&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/IRAKzuMKp2">pic.twitter.com/IRAKzuMKp2&lt;/a></p><p>According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Sam Amick</a> of The Athletic, the man that plays the mascot was <a href=#>taken</a> to the emergency room at a nearby hospital for treatment. The man was given pain medication and sent home.</p><p>To make matters more embarrassing, the Heat lost Game 4 to the Denver Nuggets on their home floor before going on to lose the series on Monday. Miami put up more of a fight in Game 5, but Denver earned a 94-89 win to claim its first NBA championship in franchise history.</p><p>As for McGregor, he has yet to return to the Octagon since suffering a broken tibia in his second straight loss to Dustin Poirier in July 2021. He's currently coaching on the 31st season of <i>The Ultimate Fighter</i> reality series opposite Michael Chandler, who he's expected to meet in his return fight later this year.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZ25%2FcYCMnKanp6JiuqSz0Z6eqKpdqK66v4yhnJqsXaKutK%2FOrWSiq12cvLCwjJqdrZ2iYrWwv8%2Biq5qkXam%2FqryMn6mopV2jr6J5xaKlmqSjYsCstdM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./alternatives-to-tablets-nyt-crossword-clue-answer.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>Alternatives to tablets NYT Crossword Clue Answer</span></a>
