It pits them against a Champions League hopeful and a club competing on several fronts.</p><p>Milan, meanwhile, are enduring a hard-enough time&nbsp;in only one campaign.</p><p>These two teams are taking two different paths this season, but this meeting in Serie A is just as important to the both of them.</p><p>The schedule right now is unforgiving for La Viola. It is undoubtedly their toughest spell: Seven matches in 22 days, a real sprint through the month of March.</p><p>Fatigue at this point is an issue. A week ago, <a href=#>Lazio</a> dismantled Fiorentina 4-0. It was an embarrassing setback for a club with fighting interests in the league, the Coppa Italia and the Europa League.</p><p><strong>Date</strong>: Monday, 16 March</p><p><strong>Time</strong>: 6 p.m. UK/2 p.m. EDT</p><p><strong>Venue</strong>: Stadio Artemio Franchi</p><p><strong>TV info</strong>: ESPN UK/Rai International, BeIN Sports (U.S. and Canada)</p><p><strong>Live stream</strong>: beIN Sports Connect (U.S. and Canada)</p><p>Up until that loss at Stadio Olimpico, Fiorentina were the Serie A team to beat. They had just ended <a href=#>Juventus</a>' 47-game unbeaten home record, and they were playing breathtaking attacking football. Lazio hit them when they were out of breath, and a subsequent 1-1 draw at home in the Europa League against Roma only confirmed suspicions of a possible burnout.</p><p>Really, there is no better pick-me-up than a game against Milan. The Rossoneri have no such excuses for their miserable form: just three wins in 2015. Injuries to starters like Nigel de Jong and Riccardo Montolivo—neither of whom made the trip to Florence—have hurt, but it is Milan's lack of belief or consistency that is truly killing them.</p><p>Coach Filippo Inzaghi <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">almost lost his job</a> last week after his team conceded an equalizer in the final seconds of an eventual 2-2 draw versus Hellas <a href=#>Verona</a>.</p><p>"The team felt the blow at the time, but over the last few days they seemed relaxed to me," Inzaghi told reporters (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">per Football Italia</a>). "We have to make up for those two lost points."</p><table><tr readability=2><td colspan=2>Fiorentina's last five Serie A matches</td></tr><tbody><tr><td>Inter vs. Fiorentina</td><td>0-1</td></tr><tr><td>Fiorentina vs. Torino</td><td>1-1</td></tr><tr><td>Sassuolo vs. Fiorentina</td><td>1-3</td></tr><tr><td>Fiorentina vs. Atalanta</td><td>3-2</td></tr></tbody><tr colspan=2><td colspan=2>acmilan.com</td></tr></table><table><tr readability=2><td colspan=2>AC Milan's last five Serie A matches</td></tr><tbody><tr><td>Chievo vs. Milan</td><td>0-0</td></tr><tr><td>Milan vs. Cesena</td><td>2-0</td></tr><tr><td>Milan vs. Empoli</td><td>1-1</td></tr><tr><td>Juventus vs. Milan</td><td>3-1</td></tr></tbody><tr colspan=2><td colspan=2>acmilan.com</td></tr></table><p><strong>Predicted Formations</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">La Gazzetta dello Sport predicts</a> yet another change in Milan's system. They could very well try out a 4-3-1-2 formation on Monday, with Keisuke Honda returning as the trequartista. Mattia Destro, who sat out the majority of the game against Verona, should also reclaim his starting position alongside Jeremy Menez, who will likely link up with Honda to give Destro support.</p><p>The midfield is still a makeshift operation. It is unlikely that Sulley Muntari will start another game in the near future, considering he has cost Milan three goals in his last two appearances. Andrea Poli will also miss the game through suspension, and De Jong and Montolivo are out.</p><p>Expect Giacomo Bonaventura to appear on the left of the midfield three. He has filled in everywhere, but the left is his side. Michael Essien and Marco van Ginkel could step back into the lineup after lengthy absences for the two of them.</p><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/atoms/lazyImage/logo.png itemprop=contentUrl thumbnail_url=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/003/466/d7e10eb4a117b3f9174053fb0df03c2a_crop_exact.jpg image=https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_800,h_533,c_fill/br-img-article/002/003/466/d7e10eb4a117b3f9174053fb0df03c2a_crop_exact.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=caption></span><span itemprop=citation class=credit>Felice Calabro'/Associated Press</span><p>There is some relief in defence as Ignazio Abate makes his comeback from a thigh problem. He should reclaim his right-back role from Daniele Bonera, while Alex and Philippe Mexes could partner up in central defence once again. Luca Antonelli is one of the few constants in the team and he will continue to play left-back as long as Mattia De Sciglio remains out.</p><p>Diego Lopez, as usual, will play in goal.</p><p>Fiorentina have to make a few changes of their own. They are without striker Mario Gomez, midfielder David Pizarro and defender Stefan Savic—big losses in each area of the field.</p><p>But they have depth. A back four consisting of Manuel Pasqual, Jose Basanta, Gonzalo Rodriguez and Micah Richards is more than serviceable. The midfield will most likely feature Matias Fernandez, Milan Badelj and Borja Valero. And a front three with Alessandro Diamanti, Josip Ilicic and Alberto Gilardino is capable of scoring. (Ilicic banged in Fiorentina's only goal in their midweek Europa League fixture.)</p><p>Mohamed Salah may get a rest, as the Egyptian has worn down over the past week.</p><p><strong>Players to Watch</strong></p><img alt="MILAN, ITALY - FEBRUARY 01: Keisuke Honda of AC Milan looks on during the Serie A match between AC Milan and Parma FC at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza on February 1, 2015 in Milan, Italy.

He has lost the momentum from the beginning of the season, when he sprinted to six goals for Milan.</p><p>Still, the 28-year-old is the catalyst that the Rossoneri need. They are starved for creativity. Honda thrives in a central role, making the 4-3-1-2 formation an ideal system for the Japanese. He has to find some comfort in the team again.</p><p>The situation is also ripe for someone like Gilardino, an ex-Milan player looking to maximize the little time he does get on the field. He has not yet started a single game for Fiorentina.</p><p><strong>Milan</strong>: +325</p><p><strong>Fiorentina</strong>: -120</p><p><strong>Draw</strong>: +240</p><p>Prediction: Fiorentina 3 Milan 1</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaWxxaGaBeHnFoqarnZ6ptq%2BtjK%2BqZpmTYrqquMCnZK2dkaJ6r7HWrGSpqpWZtqTAxJ1kpaGemnq2vNJmo6KulWLAtb7EmqRmrKZitq%2Byzg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dress-designer-wang.html><span>←</span><span>Dress designer Wang</span></a>
