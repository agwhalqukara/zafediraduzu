It’s a big year for the newly launched app that I’m not sure about, exactly. I think there’s a good chance that at 32 I’m a bit too old for the first Pokemon craze from a few years ago, and I simply don’t care about the second on seeing as how I have this thing called a life and four kids and a job and things that keep me a bit too busy for a game on my phone (will you be disappointed to know I’ve never played Candy Crush or the word game people were obsessed with a few years ago?).</p><p>The game is great for kids, but there are adults that love it, too. While we love that it’s getting kids up and out of the house and moving, we also know that it’s a game that many people are falling hard for. We know that there are celebrities playing the game – and they’re serious about it. So, just who in Hollywood is working hard to find the latest creature with a name we won’t even pretend to pronounce correctly?</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/chrissy-teigen.jpg alt="chrissy teigen" width=640 height=198 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Chrissy Teigen</h2><p>She’s got John Legend and baby Luna to worry about, but the biggest issue in her life right now is whether or not she can find herself a Pokemon in Italy. We think she can if she just puts her mind to it. Our motivational speech for her includes telling her that she can do anything she puts her mind to if she wants.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/soulja-boy.jpg alt="soulja boy" width=640 height=578 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Soulja Boy</h2><p>Can we even call him a celebrity at this point? Am I living under a rock or have we heard from him since he was doing the superman? Either way, he’s got a Pokemon on his watch (which I imagine is a Rolex or some other high-end designer timepiece) and he’s not afraid to snap a photo of it to post on Instagram before he catches it.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kevin-jonas.jpg alt="kevin jonas" width=640 height=604 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Kevin Jonas</h2><p>He’s got a new baby at home with his wife, but that’s not stopping him from looking for a Pokemon outside. He’s left all alone and by himself, however, when he realizes that there is not one out there. We appreciate his ability to joke about it, though.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/john-mayer.jpg alt="john mayer" width=640 height=580 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>John Mayer</h2><p>He’s not even kidding with his obsession. He’s spoken about it, posted about it and he’s even admitted to spending big bucks to buy things to help him get ahead in the game. We just have to say we are glad he’s got his own money and his parents aren’t going to flip out when they see the phone bill with all those in-app purchases.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/kendra-wilkinson.jpg alt="kendra wilkinson" width=640 height=221 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><h2>Kendra Wilkinson</h2><p>While some people want to see the glamorous side of the game, the former Playboy bunny and ex-girlfriend of Hugh Hefner knows that it’s not all fun and games. It’s especially not at all fun when you step in doggie doo and have to clean it up when all you wanted to do was play a game. Let this be a lesson to dog owners; clean up your mess.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGidoq6VYrCmuMSbqaKsmZrAbsPHqGSaqpVivKO%2FxKyqnpxdrLa1tIyppqSdnaS7brPOaA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./carry-pieces-of-unchecked-luggage.html><span>←</span><span>Carry-___ (pieces of unchecked luggage)</span></a>
