The Bills <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">released</a> a statement on Ryan's influence on their official website:</p><p><span>Terry and Kim Pegula and the Buffalo Bills organization want to express their deepest sympathies and condolences to Rex, Rob and the entire Ryan family on the passing of their dad, Buddy Ryan. Buddy was a legend in our league in so many ways. His defenses were innovative and he was a master at putting his talented and tough players in a position to succeed. He was a real game changer and much of his philosophies and defensive tactics are still utilized effectively by teams today. Buddy's influence will be carried on by defensive coaches for generations to come, but none more so than by Rex and Rob. Our heartfelt thoughts and prayers are with the Ryan family today.</span></p><p>Rex Ryan later issued a statement, via the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bills</a>, on his father's impact on him and his brothers, which reads in part:</p><p>For Rob and me, we've had the great fortune of sharing the coaching profession that he was so proud of and cherished so much. There is no way we can possibly begin to measure how much football we have learned from him over the years and we are forever thankful to him for instilling within us his unwavering love for the game of football.</p><p>While today is a tough day for all of us in the Ryan family, we are consoled in knowing how much dad was loved by so many and the love he gave back in return. Though we will miss him dearly, we take comfort in knowing that his memory will live on through all of us.</p><p>Bears chairman George H. McCaskey also issued a statement&nbsp;on Ryan's legacy in Chicago, <span>via&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Larry Mayer</a><span>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Chicago Bears' official website</span>:</p><p>Buddy Ryan was the architect of the greatest defense our league has seen.</p><p>He was brilliant when it came to the X’s and O’s of the game, but what made him special was his ability to create an unwavering confidence in the players he coached. From the day he was hired in 1978, his defenses bought into more than the scheme, they bought into him and took on his personality.</p><p>Buddy was brash, intelligent and tough. He was a perfect match for our city and team, which is why George Halas took the extraordinary step of keeping him at the behest of his defensive players while transitioning to a new coaching staff in 1982. We will always be grateful for Buddy’s contribution to the Bears. He is one of the team’s all-time greats. Our prayers are with his family.</p><p>While Ryan is perhaps best known for his stint as Bears defensive coordinator from 1978 to 1985, he also served as the Philadelphia Eagles' head coach from 1986 to 1990 and in the same position for the Arizona Cardinals in 1994 and 1995.</p><p>Ryan had a 55-55-1 record as a head coach and led the Eagles to the playoffs in 1988, 1989 and 1990.</p><p>Ross Tucker of NBCSN pointed out Ryan's impact as a head coach in Philadelphia:</p>Ross Tucker <span class=acct>@RossTuckerNFL</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Didn't achieve championship-level success in Philly but Buddy Ryan sure made it fun to be an Eagles fan in late 80s.

He was a fabulous coach. He invented the 46 defense."</span></p><p><span>"Today is a sad day in football due to the passing of Buddy Ryan," New England Patriots head coach <a href=#>Bill Belichick</a> said in a statement, via the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patriots</a>. "It was always very challenging to compete against Coach Ryan, who was a father to a great football family that&nbsp;carries&nbsp;on his coaching and defensive tradition. My&nbsp;condolences are with the Ryan family."</span></p><p><span>Ryan's aggressive approach to defense was an extension of himself in many ways, as evidenced by this excerpt from one of his playbooks provided by Chris B. Brown of Smart Football:</span></p>Chris B.
