It’s ridiculous. There is no secret: You just have to eat healthy, work out and torture yourself!”</p><p>Stefani hits the gym as much as possible, she adds, “but it’s more for my brain than it is for my body.” It doesn’t hurt, however, that constant exercise keeps her at a sample-size. “I like to wear clothes too much, so I try to keep focused,” Stefani explains.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="gwen stefani harpers" width=467 height=581 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>The “Settle Down” singer — mom to sons <strong>Kingston</strong>, 6, and <strong>Zuma</strong>, nearly 4 — admits that while it’s “super fun being a mom,” it’s not always easy. “Finding that balance between work and family is the hardest thing I’ve ever done,” she tells <a href=#>Harper’s Bazaar</a>. “By far.”</p><p>A showbiz veteran, the rocker tells the magazine she’s grown a thick skin over the years. “That someone would say something untrue or bad about me doesn’t bother me. It’s like water off a duck’s back,” she says. “None of that stuff matters. There’s something in me, being this passive person, that those kinds of things don’t upset me. I know they can say anything; they can just make something up. But what are you going to do? It’s not part of my reality, so it’s okay.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ6wnZ5iwLWxxZqlomWYqsCjrc2dZKCZpp67br7OrKqdmZyaeq21yp6qZqWVYrqwvsRmrqKsmGK6orfErqdmamBmf3iE</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./city-of-johannesburg-ordered-to-fork-out-over-r7m-to-woman-permanently-blinded-by-fall-into-uncovere.html><span>←</span><span>City of Johannesburg Ordered to Fork Out Over R7m to Woman Permanently Blinded by Fall Into Uncovere</span></a>
