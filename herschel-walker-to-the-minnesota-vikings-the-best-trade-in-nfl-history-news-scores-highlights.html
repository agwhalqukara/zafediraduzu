He is the all-time leading rusher with 18,355 yards. His 175 total touchdowns rank him second all-time behind Jerry Rice (207).</p><p>He is one of four players in NFL history to eclipse 21,000 yards. He is also one of the two non-kickers to score over 1,000 points in his career.</p><p>Emmitt holds many other records. He is also in the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor, and will soon be in the Hall of Fame.</p><p>Darren Woodson was selected to five pro bowls, and was named all-pro four times. He is the Cowboys' all-time leading tackler with 1,350 career tackles.</p><p>Walker played two years for the Vikings and never surpassed 1,000 rushing yards. He went on to play for the <a href=#>Eagles</a> and then the <a href=#>Giants</a> before being re-acquired by the Cowboys.</p><p>In my opinion that is one of the best trades in NFL history, and one that built the Cowboys' dynasty of the '90s.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaG1oYWaDbsDHnmSbnaOperW%2BwJ2cZqGeYrunuIyhoKysn6fG</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./friendly-suitable-for-technology-beginners.html><span>←</span><span>___-friendly (suitable for technology beginners)</span></a>
