The award-winning American actress debuted in the 80s and has enjoyed a decent career that spans TV, movies, and theatrical productions. On the big screen, she is famous for movies such as Witness, The Accused, and Top Gun.</strong></p><p>Kelly McGillis was 28 years old in Top Gun and she portrayed the iconic character of Charlie Blackstock, an astrophysicist and flight instructor who embarks on a sizzling romance with the main character, Pete Maverick – portrayed by Tom Cruise. The romance between McGillis and Cruise’s characters was one of the backbones of Top Gun and ultimately contributed to its global success. The film itself made McGillis an evergreen actress.</p><h3><strong>Kelly McGillis’ Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>AGE:</strong> 66 years old</li><li><strong>BIRTHDAY:</strong> 9th of July 1957</li><li><strong>BIRTHPLACE:</strong> Newport Beach, California, United States</li><li><strong>BIRTH SIGN:</strong> Cancer</li><li><strong>ETHNICITY:</strong> Caucasian</li><li><strong>FATHER:</strong> Donald Manson</li><li><strong>MOTHER:</strong> Joan</li><li><strong>SIBLINGS:</strong> Karen McGillis and Kathleen McGillis</li></ul><h2><strong>Kelly McGillis is a Native of Newport Beach California</strong></h2><p>Kelly McGillis is presently 66 years old as she was born on the 9th of July 1957. Her birth place is Newport Beach, California, and she has American nationality. Her ethnicity is Caucasian comprising Scottish, Irish, Welsh, and German ancestry.</p><p>McGillis hails from a family of five.

She has two younger sisters.</p><h2><strong>She Made Her Professional Acting Debut at the Age of 26</strong></h2><p>Kelly McGillis grew up in Newport Beach and attended school like any other kid. She also fell in love with acting in her teens and decided that this was what she wanted to do. Her parents disapproved, but nothing could hold her back. She dropped out of school and moved to New York, where she attended the prestigious Julliard School. She featured in a handful of theatrical productions and eventually finished her studies.</p><p>Kelly McGillis made her acting debut in the 1982 movie Reuben, Reuben. The comedy-drama revolves around a poet, Gowan, who is a chronic drunk and a leech. McGillis portrayed Geneva, a college student who fell in love with Gowan and temporarily dated him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/Kelly-McGillis.jpg><h2><strong>She Got Her Breakthrough at the Age of 27, thanks to the 1985 Film – Witness</strong></h2><p>While many actors and actresses often go for years before landing a breakthrough, this was not the case with Kelly McGillis. Just two years after her professional debut, Kelly McGillis got her breakthrough by playing the role of an Amish mother, Rachel Lapp, in the 1985 film <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Witness</a>. Witness revolves around a young Amish boy named Samuel who witnesses a murder. The penetrators aim to kill him, but a police detective named John Book protects him.</p><p>McGillis played the role of Samuel’s mom, while Harrison Ford portrayed John Book. Witness was critically and commercially acclaimed, and Kelly McGillis received multiple award nominations for her performance. They include the golden globe award nomination for best supporting actress and the BAFTA nomination for best actress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/Kelly-McGillis-1.jpg><h2><strong>Kelly McGillis was 28 Years Old When She Featured in Top Gun</strong></h2><p>Following her breakthrough in Witness, the next notable work that Kelly McGillis did was in Top Gun. Kelly was 28 years old when she featured in Top Gun No. 1. Top Gun is a 1986 action drama film about a bunch of young hotshot pilots who get the chance to train at an elite US Navy facility. Top Gun featured Tom Cruise in the lead role of Pete Maverick Mitchell, one of the pilots, while McGillis played Charlie Blackstock, one of his instructors.</p><p>The duo’s characters later embarked on a sizzling romance which was a major part of the storyline. Their work was a success. While Top Gun received some negative reviews from critics, it was a hit at the box office and grossed $357.3 million on a budget of $15 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/Kelly-McGillis-2.jpg><h2><strong>Kelly McGillis Embarked on a Hiatus from Hollywood at the Age of 44 and Made a Comeback at the Age of 50</strong></h2><p>The success of Top Gun solidified McGillis’ status as a star, and she went on to land lead roles in several movies and TV series all throughout the 80s and 90s. Some of the most notable ones include The Accused, Made in Heaven, The House On Carroll Street, Winter People, and Private Sessions. McGillis became a bona fide leading lady of her era, and many expected her to dominate. That was not to be, as she decided to embark on a hiatus in 2001.</p><p>She was aged 44 at the time, and the decision was informed by some of her bad experiences with directors. Kelly McGillis’ hiatus from Hollywood lasted about six years. During this period, she appeared in several theatrical productions. Kelly McGillis later made a comeback to the screens at the age of 50 in 2007. She has since appeared in multiple movies and TV series. Some of her recent works include Maternal Secrets (2018), Blue (2015), and An Uncommon Grace (2017).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/Kelly-McGillis-2-1.jpg><h2><strong>Why is Kelly McGillis not in the New Top Gun?</strong></h2><p>For several years, many fans of Top Gun have yearned for a sequel. Their dreams finally came true when Top Gun: Maverick was released in May 2022. Some of the old stars, notably Tom Cruise, returned to the new film while some others, notably Kelly McGillis, were missing.</p><p>Her romance arc with Tom Cruise’s character was replaced by him falling in love with a character named Penny, a bar owner and single mother who is the daughter of an admiral. Penny was portrayed by Jennifer Connelly, who is in her early 50s.</p><p>This replacement has led to questions, and those involved have scrambled to give answers. One of them is that Kelly McGillis is not in the new Top Gun because the directors didn’t want to dwell too much attention on some of the past storylines but wanted to move forward. Kelly McGillis herself believes that the reason she is not in the new Top Gun is that she is <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">old</a>, fat, and looks age appropriate for her age.</p><p>According to her, this is not what the new scene is about. The actress has also gone on to reveal that she is not perturbed by the omission as she is very comfortable in her skin and with her age.</p><h2><strong>Kelly McGillis Got Married for the First Time at the Age of 22</strong></h2><p>Kelly McGillis has been married three times, and the first time was at the age of 22. This was in 1979 when she got married to her Julliard classmate named Boyd Black. She and Black had huge aspirations for their respective careers and their life together, but the latter was not to be, as they divorced in 1981.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/Kelly-McGillis-2-4.jpg><h2><strong>Her Second Marriage was to Fred Tillman at the Age of 32</strong></h2><p>Kelly McGillis got married for a second time at the age of 32. This was in 1989, and she wed a wealthy yacht salesman named Fred Tillman. She and Tillman relocated to Key West, Florida, and made their home there. They welcomed two daughters, Kelsey (b. 1990) and Sonora (b. 1994). They also opened a restaurant together.</p><p>McGillis and Tillman were married for 13 years and divorced in 2013 amidst allegations of <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">infidelity</a> on the actress’ part.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/Kelly-McGillis-2-3.jpg><h2><strong>Kelly McGillis Came Out as Gay at the Age of 52</strong></h2><p>Kelly McGillis was 52 years old when she came out as a lesbian in 2009. She revealed that she had battled with her sexual identity since the age of 12 and believed that some of the misfortunes that befell her were a result of her sexuality. T</p><p>his train of thought led her to struggle with alcohol and substance abuse. She later cleaned herself up and publicly came out once her kids were grown and out of the house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/12/Kelly-McGillis-2-2.jpg><h2><strong>She Entered into a Civil Union With Her Girlfriend at the Age of 53</strong></h2><p>Kelly McGillis entered into a civil union at the age of 53 with her longtime girlfriend – Melanie Leis. Leis is a sales executive who once worked as a bartender at the restaurant that McGillis and her then-husband, Fred Tillman, had opened around 2000.</p><p>McGillis and Leis began dating around 2000. They later wed in a civil union in 2010. The couple’s marriage lasted for a year, and they separated in 2011.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLimuMuyZKabl565rbXSZpignV2dvLh5zqWbZq%2BRqHq0tMRmoKdlpKS9brPUp2SappRiwbCwwLJm</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./emilio-estevez-net-worth-age-height-weight-dating-and-more.html><span>←</span><span>Emilio Estevez Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</span></a>
