Here is everything we could find out about the <a href=#>star</a>.</p><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: </strong><a id=https://briefly.co.za/8119-new-facebook-algorithm-how-briefly-news-news-feed-now.html#8119 href=#>Click</a> “See First” under the “Following” tab to see Briefly News on your News Feed!</p><h3>Messi’s real height</h3><p class=align-left>Despite people asking: 'Is Messi shorter than 5 7?' (which would make him 170.18 cm), he is shorter, at just 169 cm.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/07ce7216b61fdfc6.jpg><h3>Lionel Messi’s wife</h3><p class=align-left>As mentioned earlier, he is married to Antonela Roccuzzo, his childhood sweetheart. The pair met when he was just nine years old, and she was eight years old. Their relationship only grew stronger with time, with them eventually tieing the knot in 2017 in his hometown of Rosario. So, <a href=#>how tall</a> is Messi’s <a href=#>wife</a>, you may ask? Standing at 157 cm, she is slightly shorter than her husband.</p><h3>Lionel Messi’s children</h3><p class=align-left>The happily <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married couple</a> shares three sons, Mateo Messi Roccuzzo, Ciro Messi Roccuzzo, and Thiago Messi Roccuzzo.</p><h3>Messi's father and mother's names</h3><p class=align-left>As stated in the biography, his parents' names are Jorge Messi and Celia María Cuccittini. Messi’s parent's heights are undisclosed but judging by Lionel's stature; we can safely assume that his parents are of a similar build to him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/b60b99bb1a6616d2.jpg><h3>Who is number one, Messi or Ronaldo?</h3><p class=align-left>If you have been wondering what made Messi so famous, his unrivalled talent and practical strategic approach to playing have placed him centre-stage, with various awards and accolades. Compared to <a href=#>Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, another football icon, he comes out on top, winning the prestigious Ballon d'Or a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">record-breaking</a> seven times, followed by Ronaldo with five wins.</p><h3>Can Messi speak English?</h3><p class=align-left>The football star could only speak his native tongue of Spanish for most of his life until recently. However, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">recently disclosed</a> to reporters that he has been learning English for the past two years.</p><h3>What is Messi's religion?</h3><p class=align-left>The star athlete follows the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Catholic religion</a> and is said to raise his children with the same teachings and practices.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/22a75f49e0f94142.jpg><h3>What was Messi's height at 17?</h3><p class=align-left>Is Messi short, considering his height? If we look at his height throughout the years, it is clear that he was likely never going to grow beyond the average height for a male. This is because he<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> was diagnosed</a> with growth hormone disorder at a young age, which he was subsequently treated for. As a result, at 17 years old, he was 169 cm, and Messi's height at 19 was the same, making him the same height he is now. Some have also been wondering, how high can Messi jump? According to reports, as high as 41.1 inches, an impressive fete for any athlete, especially one of his size.</p><p class=align-left>In summary, the question of 'how tall is Messi' can be easily summed up as him being of average height for a male but shorter than many of his fellow football players. However, his height has never gotten in the way of his immense talent and impressive football skills.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>Who is Marc Chalamet?
