You might recognize her as the daughter of Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne. Her family starred in a reality TV show, The Osbournes, from 2002 to 2005, and they even won an Emmy Award in 2002.</p><p>Besides TV, Kelly is also a singer.

In 2003, she teamed up with her dad, Ozzy, to make a single called Changes, which was a hit and reached number one on the UK Singles Chart.</p><p>Recently, Kelly Osbourne has been making headlines for losing a significant amount of weight, about 85 pounds. She achieved this remarkable transformation by making substantial changes in her lifestyle and also having a surgery called gastric sleeve surgery. Let’s examine how she did it by understanding her diet and workout plan.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# data-type=post data-id=1248 rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Smith Weight Loss: Unveiling the Secret Behind His Change</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Kelly Osbourne Weight Loss: Diet, Exercise, and Moderation</h2><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel="noopener nofollow">View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by FILLERS | ANTI-AGING | LEMON BOTTLE | VARIOUS LOCATIONS 🇬🇧 (@heartaesthetics.co.uk)</a></p><p>Kelly Osbourne wants to be very clear about her remarkable weight loss transformation: it’s not about giving in to social media pressure or media scrutiny. She did it for herself.</p><p>She shared,</p><p>“I did it because I wanted to live. I wanted the body to match the mind, because I, I spent so much time working on my mind and then I spent a year working on my body and now it’s about the soul.”</p><p>After undergoing <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a33637682/kelly-osbourne-reveals-gastric-sleeve-social-media/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">gastric sleeve surgery</a>, Kelly Osbourne had to make significant changes, including adjusting her diet and workout routine to prevent weight gain.</p><p>She explained,</p><p>“The kind of surgery I had if you don’t work out and you don’t eat right, you gain weight. All gastric sleeve surgery does is move you in the right direction, it doesn’t solve all your problems. It’s not a quick fix.”</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# data-type=post data-id=1296 rel="noreferrer noopener">Sarah Huckabee Sanders Weight Loss: The Truth Behind Her 50-Pound Transformation</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Kelly Osbourne’s Diet Plan</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebtransformations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/P1.png><p>One essential rule Osbourne followed in her weight loss journey was intermittent fasting. She avoided eating for 16 hours and consumed healthy meals during an 8-hour window.</p><p>According to Osbourne, gastric sleeve surgery is a helpful tool, but lifestyle changes are crucial to achieving and maintaining your goal. Therefore, she adopted a diet plan that aided her weight loss journey and promoted overall health.</p><p>She transitioned to a vegan and plant-based diet, which not only facilitated weight loss but also kept her feeling satisfied for longer. This diet offers additional health benefits, including improved gut and cardiovascular health.</p><p>Kelly eliminated foods such as milk, chicken, salami, eggs, meat, and ham from her diet. She also shared,</p><p>“I eat my fattiest meal in the morning. If I’m craving pizza, I’ll have it for breakfast, salad for lunch, and oatmeal for dinner.”</p><p>While occasionally indulging in junk food like pizza and cookies, Osbourne learned the importance of moderation and portion control. She balances such indulgences with healthier meals or additional workout sessions.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong><a href=# data-type=post data-id=1243 rel="noreferrer noopener">Nikocado Avocado Weight Loss: Overcoming Food Addiction and Shining Light on Healthy Choices</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Kelly Osbourne’s Workout Plan</h3><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel="noopener nofollow">View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel="noopener nofollow">A post shared by Kelly Osbourne (@kellyosbourne)</a></p><p>Kelly Osbourne collaborates with personal trainer <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.instagram.com/laceystonefitness/ rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lacey Stone</a> to maintain her health and prevent weight gain.</p><p>She expressed,</p><p>“Working out is something I really enjoy doing… I never thought I’d be that kind of girl.
