I was sat in the studio with Cadenza and Miraa May getting some stuff off my chest from the past few weeks.</p><p>“It was a weird time… I was dealing with friends being super unsupportive about decisions I was making and I was struggling with navigating that.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m really proud and excited about what came out in this song and I hope people love it in the same way we did when we wrote it. Rico Nasty is a badass and one of my favourite artists so getting her to feature was a huge moment for me!”</p><p>Rico Nasty added: “Covid couldn’t stop shit! So happy to be a part of this record with Mahalia.”</p><p>Jealous comes as Mahalia’s first release following her double win at the 2020 MOBO awards where the ‘I Wish I Missed My Ex’’ songstress took home awards for both ‘Best R&B/Soul Album’ and ‘Best Female Act’.</p><p>Be sure to check out their brand new single ‘Jealous’ now and head over to YouTube to watch the official music video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kuqK0wKWgmmWRo7FuvsicpmamkajBunnTnpimZaWleqe70Walnq9dqLavs8ueZKOdkaG8tr%2BO</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./latest-celebrity-and-entertainment-news.html><span>←</span><span>Latest Celebrity and Entertainment News</span></a>
