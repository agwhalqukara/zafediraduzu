<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Matt Lauer Says Tom Cruise &amp;quot;Glib&amp;quot; Interview Was His Most Awkward Ever</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>Matt Lauer</strong> didn't waste any time revealing newsroom secrets after <a href=#>joining Facebook</a> on Tuesday, June 10. The Today show co-host took part in a Q&A with former co-anchor<strong> Meredith Vieira</strong>, and also interacted with fans of the NBC morning program. When asked what was his most awkward interview ever in his career, he replied:<strong> <a href=#>Tom Cruise</a></strong>.</p><p>"A bit awkward with Tom Cruise a while back!!!!" Lauer, 56, wrote. "It was one of those unforgettable moments that became a part of pop culture."</p><p>Indeed, back in June 2005 Lauer and the 51-year-old Edge of Tomorrow actor went toe-to-toe when the topic of psychiatry vs. Scientology came up during their sit-down interview. Promoting film War of the Worlds at the time, Cruise, completely flustered, criticized friend <a href=#><strong>Brooke Shields</strong></a> for taking anti-depressants and called Lauer "glib." <a href=#>See recent pics of Tom here</a>.</p><p>"It's very impressive to listen to you," Lauer said at the time, "because clearly, you've done the homework. And you know the subject."</p><p>Cruise replied: "And you should. You don't know the history of psychiatry. I do." he added: "You just communicate about it. If I want to know something, I go and find out. Because I don't talk about things that I don't understand."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lauer <a href=#>similarly reflected on the infamous broadcast</a> eight years later during an appearance on <strong>Howard Stern's</strong> Sirius XM radio show last June. "There are times where, when you least expect it, you get someone who sits on this couch…and all of a sudden you say something and you can see in the person's' eyes a physical change," he said to the disc jockey. "That was one of those times…I knew I was going to go in a certain area, and you watch the change, and then it's your job almost to get the hell out of the way."&nbsp;</p><p>"[He] has gone out of his way to be awfully nice to me since then," Lauer noted. "He since has come forward and said, you know, that was a strange time in his life and he regrets the way it came across." (The awkward ordeal happened at the beginning of his relationship with now ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Katie Holmes</strong></a>, and shortly after couch-jumping on The Oprah Winfrey Show while discussing the Dawson's Creek alum.)</p><p>Cruise's gesture has clearly done the trick. As Lauer said during his Q&A Tuesday, the men have since put the uncomfortable incident behind them. Lauer told readers: "Important to note: he and I have a great relationship today."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKSarKRiuaLBxKtkrJmpqHq1u8xmmqutmaiybrPLoplmoZ6psrPCyJ6uZq%2BRqHqptdJmpKirpGKuuLfWmqmdZZWrsrN5jGtnamxhZoM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./makhadzi-s-english-runs-away-in-hilarious-video-and-leaves-fans-chuckling-she-must-just-leave.html><span>←</span><span>Makhadzis English Runs Away in Hilarious Video and Leaves Fans Chuckling: She Must Just Leave</span></a>
