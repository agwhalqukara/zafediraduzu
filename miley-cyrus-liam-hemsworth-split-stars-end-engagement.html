<span>Reinaldo Massengill</span></p><h1>Miley Cyrus, Liam Hemsworth Split: Stars End Engagement</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><a href=#><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Liam Hemsworth</strong></a> are officially off-again — for good, it seems. The couple, who met on the set of 2010's The Last Song, have called off their engagement, a rep for the "We Can't Stop" singer confirms to <a href=#><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a>.</p><p>"Liam and Miley are completely done and broken up," one insider told <strong>Us</strong>. Added another: "She wants nothing to do with him, and vice versa. It's bad."</p><p>Indeed, trouble has been brewing between the two stars for some time now. As <strong>Us Weekly</strong> revealed last week, Hemsworth has been looking for an out for months and and was even wooing Mad Men star <a href=#><strong>January Jones</strong></a> behind his now-ex-fiancee's back.</p><p>"They're just weeks away from calling it off permanently," one insider told <strong>Us</strong> recently of the former Disney starlet, 20, and the Hunger Games actor, 23. "Liam feels very distant emotionally from Miley these days."</p><p>"He is over her and wants to make a clean break," the source added. "No more back and forth."</p><p>One major problem in their relationship? Cyrus' rebellious, hypersexual new image, which she flaunted during her performance with <strong>Robin Thicke</strong> at the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards. "He was not pleased," another insider told <strong>Us</strong> of Hemsworth's reaction to the show. "He was embarrassed by all the attention on her."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Cyrus, for her part, hinted at trouble this past weekend, when she unfollowed Hemsworth on Twitter. The two have not been photographed together since the premiere of the actor's film Paranoia, where a source said they seemed out of sync.</p><p>"Miley and Liam acted like they didn't even know each other the entire night," the onlooker told <strong>Us</strong>. "She was wearing her ring, but they acted as if they were strangers."</p><p>Cyrus and Hemsworth have been dating off and on since 2010. They got engaged last year, in May 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKSipJWueqTF0a6qZqSZlrputMSmqrCnoqm1bq%2FApaNmp5abeqa6xpqenqWVo8Fufo9qampuaQ%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./katherine-young-obituary-rhode-island.html><span>←</span><span>Katherine Young obituary Rhode Island</span></a>
