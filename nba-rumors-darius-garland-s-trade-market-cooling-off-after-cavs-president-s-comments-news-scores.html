"And the same thing goes [for the] fit of the Evan Mobley, Jarrett Allen. There's a depth of talent here that's really, really good. And when you look at the landscape of the league and how long, like 82 games, we can't discount [the impact of] injuries.</p><p>"...I know people want to talk about the fit I push back on that in terms of just the net ratings, but I also want to talk about the depth of talent here. That's really good that keeps us alive when we have to go through some injury spells."</p><p>A breakout All-Star during 2022, Garland has taken a backseat over the last two seasons to the ball-dominant Mitchell. Cleveland has made the playoffs with the pairing in place, but it's clear Garland could do more if given a bigger role.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>NBA insider Marc Stein</a> reported the 24-year-old could even seek a trade if Mitchell signs a long-term contract extension this summer in Cleveland.</p><p>If Mitchell does not ink a new deal, the Cavs will likely have to explore trading their All-Star guard just two years after backing up a Brinks truck of assets to acquire him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmmBc3%2BMp5maZaKqurC%2B0mabmqqZqsBus8Cro5qmlKh6tb7AnZxmpZGnuKbAjJymqKSZo7Ruu8WfZJqepJq%2Fbq%2FAr6pmqKKawKqwxKerrGWTpLqusc2tqg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-s-in-a-name-angelina-jolie-s-twins-knox-leon-and-vivienne-marcheline.html><span>←</span><span>What's in a Name?
