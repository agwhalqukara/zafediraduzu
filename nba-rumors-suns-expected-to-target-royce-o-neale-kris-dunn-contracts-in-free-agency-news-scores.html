Givony referenced how Phoenix once again has its hands tied from a roster perspective, so the team could move off the No. 22 pick in the 2024 NBA draft.
&#34;Trading back to resupply their depleted stockpile of assets (especially future picks) is another option the Suns' front office is said to be considering, due to the severely limited mechanics the team has to add talent with the punitive new second-apron rules that go into effect this summer,&#34;"><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>

If he were to leave, the team wouldn't be able to table the same kind of contract offer to an outside free agent. Scotto reported he's expected to get a deal extending for three or four years at around $10 million annually.</p><p>In terms of additions, the draft would be a straightforward mechanism through which the Suns could address their obvious need for a point guard. Bleacher Report's <a href=#>Jonathan Wasserman</a> projected them to take USC's Isaiah Collier in his newest mock draft.</p><p>The downside with Collier — or pretty much any prospect in the latter half of the draft — is that there's no guarantee he'd be able to contribute positively on a team looking to win now.</p><p>The Trojans star averaged 16.3 points and 4.3 assists to 3.3 turnovers in 30.0 minutes per game. He also shot just 33.8 percent from beyond the arc. His draft stock steadily fell as the 2023-24 season unfolded.</p><p>Dunn wouldn't be an ambitious signing but obviously possesses far more experience and more certainty in terms of what he'd deliver. In 66 games with the Utah Jazz this past year, he put up 5.4 points and 3.8 assists per contest. His 36.9 percent clip on three-pointers wasn't great but well above his career average (32.3).</p><p>The Suns pulled off one of last summer's biggest blockbusters when they acquired Bradley Beal. It will inevitably be a much quieter offseason this time around.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYmqFc4OMp5maZaKqurC%2B0maqrqajYrK5vMScq56cXam8bsDAq56erF2nvLqvxGamp52RobJut9GiqmacpaO7bq%2FOp6urmZOpwG61zWadq52VYq6osc2csA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./la-times-fixes-beforehand-crossword-clue-answers-with-4-letters.html><span>←</span><span>LA Times Fixes beforehand Crossword Clue Answers with 4 letters</span></a>
