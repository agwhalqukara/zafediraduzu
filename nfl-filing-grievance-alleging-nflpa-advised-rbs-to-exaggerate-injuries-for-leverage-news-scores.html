The alleged advice to feign injuries was <a href=# rel=noopener>reportedly made</a> during a formal Zoom call between the NFLPA and certain players at the position.</p><p>In July, Tretter appeared on the <i>Ross Tucker Podcast</i> and appeared to suggest that players could use injuries as a form of leverage:</p>Ross Tucker Podcast <span class=acct>@RossTuckerPod</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>"You need to try to create as much leverage as you possibly can…"&lt;br>&lt;br>Interesting response from NFLPA President &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JCTretter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@JCTretter&lt;/a> when asked if players like Saquon Barkley should fake injuries for contract purposes: &lt;a href="https://t.co/mgBYNmUlJL">pic.twitter.com/mgBYNmUlJL&lt;/a></p>"You need to try to create as much leverage as you possibly can. And that's the tough thing with the franchise tag, or being restricted in movement, is it decreases your leverage, but then you have to find creative ways to build leverage elsewhere. I think we've seen issues—now, I don't think anybody would say they were fake injuries—but we've seen players who didn't want to be where they currently are, have injuries that made them unable to practice and play, but you're not able to get fined, and you're not able to be punished for not reporting. So there are issues like that. I don't think I'm allowed to ever recommend that, at least publicly, but I think each player needs to find a way to build up leverage to try to get a fair deal. And that's really what all these guys are looking for, is to be compensated fairly."<p>Those comments will almost assuredly be used against Tretter in the NFL's grievance.</p><p>The depressed running back market was one of the storylines of the summer, as players like Saquon Barkley and Josh Jacobs held out rather than signing their franchise tags before ultimately signing revised one-year deals.</p><p>And Jonathan Taylor sought a trade after he couldn't come to terms with the Indianapolis Colts on a contract extension and is currently on injured reserve. It is unclear if he will suit up for the team this season.</p><p>A number of star running backs also <a href=# rel=noopener>held a Zoom meeting</a> in July regarding the depressed market for their position, which reportedly included Barkley, Jacobs, Austin Ekeler, Nick Chubb, Derrick Henry and Christian McCaffrey.</p><p>"Right now, there's really nothing we can do," Chubb said at the time. "We're kind of handcuffed with the situation. We're the only position that our production hurts us the most. If we go out there and run 2,000 yards with so many carries, the next year they're going to say, 'You're probably worn down.' It's tough. ... It hurts us at the end of the day."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaG6Gdn6Mp52lZZaeuaq6xmaeq6GVq66vr8RmmKWklZy2r7OMp52lqJFirqXCyKycnWWil8BuwM5mnLGZl5yys63TnmSippqqv6qx0madqKpdobK3sdGanp4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./jonathan-bailey-unveiling-the-bridgerton-star-s-personal-and-professional-highlights.html><span>←</span><span>Jonathan Bailey: Unveiling the Bridgerton Stars Personal and Professional Highlights</span></a>
