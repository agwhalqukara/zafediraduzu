I did so almost twenty years ago. I never knew that I would have to do it all over again publicly just because I reunited with NKOTB! I have lived my life very openly and have never hidden the fact that I am gay! Apparently the prerequisite to being a gay public figure is to appear on the cover of a magazine with the caption 'I am gay'. I apologize for not doing so if this is what was expected!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>During an appearance on Bravo's Watch What Happens Live, "I Think We're Alone Now" singer <strong>Tiffany</strong> dished that she and Jonathan dated back when she toured with the hugely popular group.</p><p>"[He] became gay later," Tiffany joshed. "I didn't do it. I had issues with that. I was thinking maybe I did. Now looking back when we were dating, he was so much fun. We used to do facials together. He was so easy to talk to."</p><p>Adds Knight in his statement: "I love living my life being open and honest, but at this time I choose not to discuss my private life any further! My fellow band members don't discuss their private lives with their loved ones and I don't feel that just because I am gay, I should have to discuss mine!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaKWkp6SXequ7zZqroZmeYrivtcahq2ahnWK0osWMa2dqaWNmfg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ms-rachel-net-worth-career-salary-and-personal-life.html><span>←</span><span>MS Rachel Net worth, Career, Salary, and Personal life</span></a>
