They often aligned him to the passing strength and put him on the field in favor of either Nakobe Dean or Channing Tindall on passing downs whenever possible. Though only an average athlete in space, Walker has an excellent understanding for zone coverage. He knows how to re-route players into different zone defenders, and he knows exactly where he needs to flow to after passing off routes. Walker seldom gave up air around pass-catchers in coverage and consistently triggered quickly to play the ball or make a tackle.</p><p>Walker is a competent run defender as well. Like all Georgia defenders, Walker has a nasty demeanor towards contact and is willing to get scrappy in traffic. His strength wavers at times, but he always finds himself near the action, thanks in part to comfortable movement skills in tight spaces and reliable run game diagnoses. He also shows a full toolbox for being able to deconstruct or avoid blocks, even if his physical profile makes it tough to capitalize on all the time. The flip side is that Walker's average speed and clunky redirection can get him caught in space a bit too often, which could become more of an issue in the pros.</p><p>Walker has the high-floor run defense traits and zone coverage chops to stick around for a long time, either at MIKE or WILL. He clearly gets how to play the position and has the aggressive mindset teams should love. Walker's average athletic profile may hold him back from reaching Pro Bowl caliber play, but it is tough to imagine Walker being anything less than a good backup, and he may well end up as a solid starter.</p><p><b>GRADE</b>: 7.6 (Potential Impact Player - 2nd Round)</p><p><b>PRO COMPARISON</b>: Anthony Walker Jr.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloYmaAeoWMqqyasV2srq23xKtkp56cYrGzrcWtZGtoYmd6tK%2FOrquippdiv6a8zqurZp6fp3qosc6rnqKZXaGv</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./mlb-joe-dimaggio-s-56-game-hitting-streak-and-mlb-s-25-most-unbreakable-records-news-scores-hig.html><span>←</span><span>MLB: Joe DiMaggio's 56-Game Hitting Streak and MLB's 25 Most Unbreakable Records | News, Scores, Hig</span></a>
