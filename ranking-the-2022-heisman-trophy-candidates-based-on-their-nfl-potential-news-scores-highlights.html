Stroud should be a lock to hear his name called during the top 10 picks of the 2023 NFL draft. Even so, this season has been somewhat of a disappointment.</p><p>Although the Buckeyes backed their way into the College Football Playoff, they did so after being stomped by the rival Michigan Wolverines in Columbus. Slight concerns about Stroud have turned into major ones.</p><p>When the two-time Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year is working in rhythm and executing the offense, he's as dangerous as they come. Stroud is a smooth and efficient operator capable of making fantastic, pinpoint throws down the field.</p><p>Quarterbacks who competently and consistently work within the scheme shouldn't be viewed as a negative. The definition of the position is to be a distributor and execute the plays called by the coaching staff. However, the evolution of the position demands more, particularly at the NFL level.</p><p>While proper execution remains at the forefront, an ability to create and work outside of structure is more important than ever. Pockets are hardly ever clean. Defenders are almost always swarming around quarterbacks. Poise, pocket feel and creativity are now essentials.</p><p>Stroud tends to struggle when he's asked to work off-platform. Despite his obvious athletic traits, he rarely ever creates with his legs. Quarterbacks don't necessarily need to be amazing athletes to create scrambling yardage. But the extension of plays, which allows receivers down the field to get open, can be back-breaking for opposing defenses.</p><p>Alabama quarterback Bryce Young—last season's Heisman Trophy winner—is more natural playing the position. Stroud brings more prototypical traits. Both should be off the board very quickly once April's draft begins.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloZWyGc4GMq5ino5mjtG7Ax55ka2hiZ3qpscispJqmXam%2FsLzHsmScmZ6ZtqWt056qZpqRqLKlec6nZK2glZ6%2FbrrFpWSpp6Sau7W1wKU%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./kim-kardashian-pets-celebrity-pets.html><span>←</span><span>Kim Kardashian Pets - Celebrity Pets</span></a>
