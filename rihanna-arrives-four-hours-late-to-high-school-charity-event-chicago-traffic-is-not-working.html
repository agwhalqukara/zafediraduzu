Rihanna had asked schools to create videos showing their charitable work.</p><p>"On my way to Barrington High School in Chicago!" she <a href=#>tweeted</a> Friday. "I can't wait to meet these kids man! They're major inspirational life changers."</p><p>But the star didn't get to meet her young fans as soon as she thought. "This Chicago traffic is not working," Rihanna tweeted with a picture of her car sitting in traffic.</p><p>As she waited, Rihanna praised Barrington High School's hard work on Twitter by sharing some facts. "They raised 40 thousand dollars for Joplin Missouri after the tragic tornado hit Missouri in May last year," she wrote. "They participated in the relay for life for the American Cancer Society and raised $700,000."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"They partnered up with Gigi's Playhouse a Down syndrome awareness center and created a video for their banquet and raised 245,000," she continued. "They travel to S. Dakota every year to help the people of the Native American community on the crow creek reservation! They raised 35,000 to build houses and help meet the needs of the communities."</p><p>Though some students told The Chicago Tribune they thought it was "rude" that Rihanna was so late to the event, the paper also says they quickly forgot their anger when she finally arrived. "Thank you guys for coming and waiting," she told the crowd.</p><p>But after a 16-minute visit, Rihanna was already back on the road. "BHS thank you man! You guys RULE!" she tweeted. "I love this school!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKmioJGju6J5wKupoq6VqHqnu9SrZKGnpafAbrjArZxmrJ9itaqzx2aqnKCfpLlur8eaqaKsqWKyt7HNrWScoJmYrqi7jK2pmp6WnrButdJmpaisXay8s7fIp55mamBmgHOAkg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./propiedades-y-beneficios-del-selenio.html><span>←</span><span>Propiedades y beneficios del selenio</span></a>
