<span>Larita Shotwell</span></p><h1>Saraya Shares Sultry Swimsuit Photo as &amp;quot;60s Girl&amp;quot; Celebwell</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><span>Saraya Bevis, otherwise known as the WWE's Paige, is offering some major retro vibes ‚Äì in her swimsuit. In a new vintage-inspired social media post the AEW wrestler flaunts her amazing body in a bathing suit. "60s girl," she captioned the set of Instagram snaps, driving her followers wild. "Smash," commented one of them. "</span><span>SHE'S STUNNING!!!" added another. How does the wrestler approach health and wellness? Celebwell rounded up her top lifestyle habits.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>After being let go of the WWE, Saraya never thought she would wrestle again and was "in limbo" for five years. "I started training more, getting in the gym, I was working out every single day," she told </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Muscle & Fitness</span></a><span>. "I started watching AEW, religiously, every single day, I was like; 'this is so cool!' and I always wanted to be a part of it, so bad since it started anyway, but yeah, it's just been a crazy journey. I never thought I'd be here, I never thought I'd be in Wembley Stadium, in the biggest crowd in wrestling history, I mean it's just a dream come true and I'm so thankful, and thank you Tony, so much."</span></p><p><span>Saraya recently started riding horses again. "Had so much fun getting back on a horse again. It's been years and I missed it alot! ü•π Thanks to </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>@taylorey</span></a><span> and </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>@raquellie</span></a><span> arranging it! A lovely surprise," she captioned a post from the Sunset Ranch in Hollywood.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/01/shutterstock_1307729137.jpg><p><span>Paige was interviewed on Renee Paquette's "Oral Sessions" podcast and discussed her sobriety. "I've been drug free for three years and I have not been drinking for over two, which is really cool," she said. "Honestly, the drug thing, (stopping drugs), kind of happened when I got the call that I could go back to WWE because that lifted my spirits a lot. I was like, 'Damn, well, I don't want to f*ck up anymore.' Then, seeing this little girl randomly at a grocery store, I looked like do-do. I was really, really skinny and it was a really bad time and stuff. She looked at me like I was a superhero, like I was Wonder Woman or something. Obviously, she doesn't read social media, so she doesn't see me in the headlines or whatever. She was so happy to see me and she said, 'I want to be like you one day.' It really was an awakening moment.</span></p><p><span>On the podcast she also discussed her vegan diet. "Also, I completely cut all meat and dairy out. I'm not one of those crazy vegans that are just like, 'You have to be vegan, if not, you're going to go to hell.' I love animals, but it's not about that. I'm just so addicted to being healthy now and feeling good and having my skin look good," she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Saraya discussed her workouts with </span><a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#><span>Muscle & Fitness</span></a><span>. "It can be hard to find somewhere to train, but when we are on the road it's usually 3 ‚Äì 4 times per week. I love to lift weights, so squats and snatches are the things I like to do. I'm not a fan of cardio, but I do like to sprint. When we need that extra workout some of us will run up and down an arena staircase!" she said.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo8PEpaNnm5%2BifLSt0ZqwmmWjna6zsdJmqq6kpKfGbr%2FWoqSsrZmperG0zq2mZpmjYoNxv4ygoKukXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./more-than-a-100k-pyramid-how-michael-strahan-s-kids-will-benefit-from-his-65m-fortune.html><span>‚Üê</span><span>More Than A $100K Pyramid: How Michael Strahan's Kids Will Benefit From His $65M Fortune</span></a>
