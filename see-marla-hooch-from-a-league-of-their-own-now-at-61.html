In the interview with Houston Life, Cavanagh said that she loves the new show and that she attended both of its premieres.</p><p>"I did the premiere in Rockford [Illinois] and the one in LA—they invited me to both of them," she said. "I moderated a talk-back when we watched it in Rockford and we had this discussion with the cast and crew and it was amazing. It is so good. I'm almost going to start crying. It takes it to another level. It's not playing the characters that we played, but there are homages to the movie."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmppmioa5utM6omqFlkWK5pq3Grpxmp5ZiwamxyKtkqK%2BeYruww4ynnLCrXw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./nfl-rumors-marquez-valdes-scantling-released-by-chiefs-saves-12m-in-cap-space-news-scores-hig.html><span>←</span><span>NFL Rumors: Marquez Valdes-Scantling Released by Chiefs; Saves $12M in Cap Space | News, Scores, Hig</span></a>
