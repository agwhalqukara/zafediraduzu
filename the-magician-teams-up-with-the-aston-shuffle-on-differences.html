We love each other’s work, and Aston Shuffle was the first signature on my label Potion Records. We shared some demo ideas and decided to choose to work on this beautiful little melody which took us back to childhood memories! We arranged our beat/bass/chords/skills to the melody and then in a studio in Brooklyn we recorded the singer Remy, who added his own vibe to it.”</p><p>Seconding The Magician’s enthusiasm, The Aston Shuffle adds, “I’ve released a lot of music on Potion over the years, as well as played a lot of shows with The Magician in the US and Europe. We always spoke about how we’d love to work on something together, so I’m super happy we finally found the time to do it!”</p><p>Singer-songwriter Remy, who has worked with The Chainsmokers, Tate McRae, and Anitta, adds his evocative vocals to “Differences.”</p><p>As a founder of the iconic nu-disco and Balearic house duo Aeroplane, The Magician helped pioneer the confluence of accessibility and progression within the <a href=#>genre</a>, disembarking from the flight in 2010 to chart his way forward.</p><p>The Magician’s hits include his multi-platinum remix of Lykke Li’s “I Follow Rivers,” “Sunlight” with Years & Years, “You and Me,” and “Hippies,” featuring Two Another, as well as dazzling live performances at Coachella, Primavera Sound Festival, Hideout Croatia, EDC Las Vegas, and Tomorrowland.</p><p>Australian producer and DJ, The Aston Shuffle has amassed more than 150 million streams with knockouts such as “Stay” with Dana Williams, “Care A Little Less (Tobtok & Adam Griffin Remix),” “Sunrise (Won’t Get Lost),” and “Tear It Down.”</p><p>“Differences” rolls out on spiraling coloration, followed by a contagiously tight rhythm. Remy’s smooth, lush voice gives the lyrics soft, velvety flavors.</p><p>“You / You like a spider going back and forth / You know it’s true / You / You throwing things and I’ve been slamming doors / And I know we’ve got our differences.”</p><p>With “Differences,” The Magician and The Aston Shuffle merge their superb talents, producing a bewitching house track.</p><p>Follow The Magician <a href=#>Instagram</a> | <a href=#>Twitter</a> | <a href=#>Facebook</a> | <a href=#>Spotify</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kwamxjKaYoKGTnq6vedOemKarXaq9bsPIrZ9mrJiaeqK%2F06ilZquYqrOnuMRmpqdllJ6zp7HRnqWcnaNk</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./how-tall-is-cnn-s-chris-cuomo-and-how-old-is-he.html><span>←</span><span>How tall is CNNs Chris Cuomo and how old is he?</span></a>
