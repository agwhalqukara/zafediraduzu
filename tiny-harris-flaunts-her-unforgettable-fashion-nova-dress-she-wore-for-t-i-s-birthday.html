Fan of tiny since forever. Can’t wait to see you this weekend in Augusta, Ga.’</p><p>A lot of people called these two’s romance, ‘relationship goals’.</p><p>Someone said: ‘That man holding you like he doesn’t EVA wanna let go! 💕’</p><p>One follower brought up the incident that Tiny went through lately and said: ‘@majorgirl I’m praying for you, I heard about the incident. According to the Bible, it says that if a thief is found amongst you he will have to pay 7 fold. So, therefore, you’re coming out with a huge blessing. The devil doesn’t care who he use & God is gonna get them.’</p><p>Regarding the robbery of Tiny’s jewelry, it’s been recently reported that Wendy Williams has a theory about the sad event.</p><p>You may recall that Tiny was robbed of no less than $750k worth of jewelry.</p><p>The expensive accessories were apparently stolen from her car and Wendy Williams thinks <a href=#>there are only two possible things</a> that might have happened.</p><p>Wendy said the following: ‘Mrs. Harris… All I am saying Tiny is either you did not lock your door or maybe this was an inside job. But, hopefully, the cameras are working [around the area her car was parked] and we will know the truth soon. I do not understand how you keep almost $1 million worth of jewelry in the console of your car on a regular basis.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Regardless of what happened, Tiny continues to live her best life together with her family and friends.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeknru6eceaqauho2Kzra3Up6usZZiav27BzZ%2Bmq5%2BVqcGirsueZJ%2BZo522sLqMp6avmV2Zv6a%2F0maqoZ1drLyzsYyfpqtlpGK2br%2BMm6CrrJiZrrp5kmtvbXFlZA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./spider-man-homecoming-star-who-is-jacob-batalon-explore-his-wiki-facts.html><span>←</span><span>Spider-Man: Homecoming Star; Who is Jacob Batalon?EXPLORE His Wiki Facts</span></a>
