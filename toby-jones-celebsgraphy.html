This is one of the most fundamental principles of performing arts. Many emotions are expressed in terms of action rather than focusing on dialogue. “Charlie Chaplin” is the legendary example of this technique. It is widely used in my acts. In miming, finding the words through movement is an important factor. It makes an actor more strong and concrete performer. An actor learns to do experiment with the gestures and postures rather than indulging in lengthy dialogues.</span></p><p><span><table id=tablepress-154 class="tablepress tablepress-id-154"><tr class="row-1 odd"><th class=column-1>Quick Infos</th><th class=column-2></th></tr><tbody class=row-hover readability=5><tr class="row-2 even" readability=2><td class=column-1>Full Name</td><td class=column-2>Tobias Edward Heslewood Jones</td></tr><tr class="row-3 odd"><td class=column-1>Date of Birth</td><td class=column-2>7 September 1966</td></tr><tr class="row-4 even" readability=4><td class=column-1>Birth Place</td><td class=column-2>Hammersmith, London, England</td></tr><tr class="row-5 odd" readability=2><td class=column-1>Parent(s)</td><td class=column-2>Jennifer Jones and Freddie Jones</td></tr><tr class="row-6 even"><td class=column-1>Occupation</td><td class=column-2>Actor<br></td></tr><tr class="row-7 odd" readability=2><td class=column-1>Spouse(s)</td><td class=column-2>Karen Jones ​(m. 2015)​</td></tr><tr class="row-8 even"><td class=column-1>Net Worth</td><td class=column-2>US $145 Million</td></tr></tbody></table></span></p><p><span>Moreover, this technique helps actors to understand the real taste of meaning and create interest in the field.
