Yes, his typical daily breakfast is nothing more than a smoothie.&nbsp;</p><p>The smoothie Brady drinks every morning for breakfast contains natural fruits like bananas, blueberries, strawberries, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>The smoothie also has a lot of seeds and nuts to add more protein.&nbsp;</p><p>A lot of the ingredients Brady uses in his meals are grown in his own garden so that he has full-guarantee that his food is all-natural.</p><p>Brady says that this smoothie is “nutrient-dense, high in fat, high in protein, and high in calories.” He also says he tries to avoid solid foods in the morning, so it doesn’t affect his morning workout.&nbsp;</p><p>Considering Brady wakes up at 6 a.m. every morning, this is only considered his first breakfast.&nbsp;</p><p>After the workout, Brady makes a protein shake that consists of his own protein powder, more of his electrolyte concentrate, and almond milk.
