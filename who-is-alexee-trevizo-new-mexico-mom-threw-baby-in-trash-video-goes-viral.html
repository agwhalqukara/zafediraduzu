It is reported that in December 2022, Alexee Trevizo sought medical assistance at a hospital in Artesia, New Mexico, complaining of significant back pain.</p><p>She received treatment and was subsequently discharged.</p><p>The details of this case are both tragic and deeply unsettling, leaving the public astonished.</p><p>As the investigation continues, it is imperative to respect the legal process and allow authorities to thoroughly examine the evidence in order to provide justice for all parties involved.</p><p>Following her initial visit in December, Alexee Trevizo returned to the hospital a few weeks later in January, this time complaining of back discomfort.</p><p>According to medical staff, she proceeded to lock herself in a bathroom where she gave birth to a baby. Shockingly, Trevizo then placed the newborn inside a trash can before leaving the premises.</p><p>The Artesia Police Department recently charged Trevizo with first-degree murder, as well as child abuse resulting in death and tampering with evidence.</p><p>These charges reflect the gravity of the situation.</p><p>The body camera footage captured the moment when the police confronted the 19-year-old, revealing a startling confession.</p><p>In the footage, Trevizo is heard saying, “It came out of me, I didn’t know what to do… I disposed of it in the bag with the trash. Mom, I’m sorry.”</p><p>These chilling revelations have deeply impacted the public, as the tragic circumstances surrounding the incident continue to unfold.</p><p>As the legal process proceeds, it remains essential to respect the investigative procedures and ensure justice for all parties involved.</p><p>After the incident, <a href=#>the body</a> of the newborn was taken to the Office of the Medical Investigator of New Mexico for an autopsy.</p><p>The autopsy findings revealed that the baby had air in its lungs at the time of death, indicating that the cause of death was homicide and not a stillbirth.</p><p>Gary C. Mitchell, the attorney representing Alexee Trevizo, stated that his client was unaware of her pregnancy when she visited <a href=#>Artesia General Hospital</a> on January 27.</p><p>Mitchell argued that Trevizo should not be charged with murder, highlighting her lack of criminal history.</p><p>He also pointed out inconsistencies in the events that unfolded at the hospital, suggesting that this was not a typical case of child abuse.</p><p>The conflicting details surrounding the case raise important questions and underscore the need for a thorough investigation to establish the truth.</p><p>As the legal proceedings continue, it is crucial to ensure fairness and consider all relevant factors in order to reach a just resolution.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmibnq6urMHNnaBnm5%2BifLi0zmagrGWRobK5scRmq6udpp7HsHnNnq5mpZWttqS7jKampmWknb%2Bmw4ybmJuxXZ67bsDRmqqhZaaesaa7jKCmnqtdq7azrcto</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./what-does-tom-brady-eat-for-breakfast.html><span>←</span><span>What Does Tom Brady Eat For Breakfast?</span></a>
