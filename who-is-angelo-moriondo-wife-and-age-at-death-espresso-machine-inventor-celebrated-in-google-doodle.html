Sadly, Moriondo passed away on May 31, 1914, just outside of his hometown, Turin.</p><h2 id=espresso-machine-inventor-angelo-moriondo-wiki>Espresso Machine Inventor Angelo Moriondo Wiki</h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Angelo Moriondo is credited for patenting the earliest known espresso machine in 1884. Moriondo came up with the idea of a coffee machine effectively in the hope of achieving an edge over his competitor at a time when coffee was a prevalent beverage across Europe and in Italy in particular, but it still turned on brewing methods that needed the consumer to wait five minutes or more to be able to raise a cup to his mouth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.mixedarticle.com/uploads/2022/6/ff7e2bba-5296-45e9-975a-3ede8ad7008b.webp><p>He delivered his invention at the General Expo of Turin in 1884, and the patent was awarded for a duration of six years on May 16, 1884. The machine was actually built by a mechanic, Martina, serving under the direct supervision of the inventor. And now, Google came up with a unique doodle on Monday to celebrate Moriondo’s 171st birth anniversary.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOmqWgnZykeq670aKmp5yfYsSqssRmmKecXZa0pnnArWSdnZGptXA%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./rita-ora-dazzles-in-strapless-gown-on-the-voice-generations-as-she-plans-to-buy-a-house-in-australia.html><span>←</span><span>Rita Ora dazzles in strapless gown on The Voice Generations as she plans to buy a house in Australia</span></a>
