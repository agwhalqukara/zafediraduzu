I’ve always wondered if I had the willpower to actually do it. And I’ll always have pride around the sense that I can.”</p><p>Efron — who first rose to fame as basketball heartthrob Troy Bolton in the High School Musical movies — has always challenged himself to do more. “I could pick up almost anything. If you put it in front of me, I could always find a way to tackle it,” he says of his rigorous training regimen. “I was never a natural at anything, but I could always outwork everybody.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>To build muscle, Efron began each day at 5:30 a.m. with a high-protein meal (“a shake and, you know, an eight-egg omelet,” he says) followed by a morning workout. By day’s end, he aimed to consume 3,500 calories.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Efron also worked with Logan Hood of Epoch Training, and he was soon able to lift more than ever before. “You get this strange sense of power as those weights increase,” he tells <a href=#>Men’s Health</a>. Efron worked out five days a week, about an hour each time. “If you’re eating appropriately and getting enough rest, you don’t need to train all day,” Hood explains. “All the work’s happening when you’re outside of the gym.”</p><p>Efron’s new movie, The Lucky One, is in theaters April 20.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmmaicqWS7psPSaLGam12as7O7zWagZpyZmbu1edGemqifnp7HpnnMsqqepJZirqfAxKtkoJmZo7avs4xqb2aon6q7pb%2BMqJ1mpaWosK2xjGtnamphaIE%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./worker-who-might-be-paid-by-the-day-nyt-crossword-clue-answer.html><span>←</span><span>Worker who might be paid by the day NYT Crossword Clue Answer</span></a>
